HOW TO USE: Analyse_Images.ijm

1. Find your Fiji install location and open the macros folder.
    a. On Windows this is usually "C:/Users/%YOUR_USERNAME%/AppData/Local/fiji-win64/Fiji.app/macros/"
    b. On Mac this is usually "/Applications/Fiji.app/macros/"
    c. If you can't find the install location, right click the Fiji shortcut and select "Open file location". This will take you to the installation folder.

2. Copy the entire folder "pk/" into your Fiji macros folder. Your macros folder should now have a "pk/" folder, with all of the custom macros contained within.

3. The macro runs using the "Analyse_Images.ijm" file. You can safely copy this file anywhere you like on your computer for easier access.
    (The location of this file does not affect what images the macro will actually run on)

4. To run the macro, open "Analyse_Images.ijm" in Fiji/ImageJ.

5. The macro can be run by:
    a. "Ctrl + R" (Windows & Linux)
    b. "Command + R" (Mac)
    c. Pressing the "Run" button in the Fiji editor

6. This will start the macro plugin. You must then specify the path to the files, as well as what options you want to use for the macro.
